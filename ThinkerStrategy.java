/**
 * An advanced cheat strategy:
 * 1. Decision on whether to cheat - The Thinker should cheat if it has to.
 *    It should also occasionally cheat when it doesnâ€™t have to.
 * 2. Choose hand - If cheating, the Thinker is more likely to
 *    choose higher cards to discard than low cards. If not cheating, it
 *    usually plays all its cards but occasionally play a random number.
 * 3. Calling Cheat - The Thinker attempts to make an informed
 *    decision to call cheat on another player. It stores all of its own
 *    cards it has placed in the discard, then examine this record (in
 *    conjunction with the current hand) to decide on whether to call cheat. It
 *    always calls cheat if the bid is not possible based on previous
 *    known play. It should then call cheat with a small probability p (set as
 *    a parameter) dependent on how many of the current rank are in the
 *    current discard pile.
